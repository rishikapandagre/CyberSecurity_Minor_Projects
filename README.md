Projects Overview

1. Web Port Scanner
Simple TCP port scanner for learning network probing techniques and service discovery in lab/sandbox environments.

2. Bruteforce Decryption (Python)
Educational brute-force / dictionary-attack script for attempting to recover a passphrase for a locally stored, sample encrypted file. Intended for demonstrating password-strength weaknesses and defensive testing only.

3. Phishing Link Detector (Python)
Heuristic + ML-based URL classifier to detect potentially malicious / phishing links. Meant for experimentation with feature extraction and basic models, not as a production-grade detector.
